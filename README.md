# TechTrend-Trader

## ✅ Project Overview  
A Python-based trend identification and simulated trading system driven by candlestick charts and technical indicators.  
Automatically fetches market data, detects trend structures, generates buy/sell signals, and performs backtesting.  
Ideal for quantitative trading beginners to build a technical analysis framework from scratch.

---

## 📌 Project Goals  
- Automatically obtain historical futures/stock index data (e.g., Gold, Crude Oil, CSI 300)  
- Visualize candlestick charts with common indicators (MA, RSI, Volume)  
- Implement automatic identification of trend highs and lows based on Dow Theory  
- Generate buy/sell signals using indicator combinations  
- Validate strategy performance via a backtesting engine

## 🚀 Recommended Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### Stage 1: Data Acquisition & Visualization  
- Fetch historical market data  
- Plot candlestick charts with moving averages (MA) and RSI indicators  

### Stage 2: Trend Identification & Signal Generation  
- Automatically mark higher highs/lows and lower highs/lows following Dow Theory  
- Generate buy/sell signals using MA crossovers, RSI, etc.

### Stage 3: Backtesting & Performance Analysis  
- Simulate trades based on generated signals  
- Calculate profit/loss, win rate, maximum drawdown  
- Visualize equity curve and signal distribution

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Planned)

- Position sizing and risk management (fixed sizing, dynamic stop-loss)  
- Multi-factor strategy combinations  
- Multi-instrument backtesting comparison  
- Integration with professional backtesting frameworks like `backtrader`
